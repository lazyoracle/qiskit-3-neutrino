# qiskit-3-neutrino: Neutrino oscillations in a 3 level quantum system

Harnessing the power of 3-level systems such as transmon qutrits to the standard three-flavor paradigm of neutrino oscillations.

[Hackathon Schedule v1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/justjosie/event-info-and-assets/master/eu_hackathon/QiskitHackathonEurope_ResearchStudyGroups_AttendeeGuide_V1.pdf)

### Project Proposal

**Due Date**: April 29, 2021

 A project proposal should include 3 slides describing:
 - [ ] Project idea
 - [ ] Impact and goals
 - [ ] Implementation plan: timeline, tasks & resources (research papers, Qiskit libraries/modules...)

### Final Project

**Due Date**: June 4, 2021

The final submission should include:

- **Scientific report** - 2-3 pages in pdf format, including:
  - [ ] Motivation (Which research questions do you want to address with this project?)
  - [ ] Implementation (What was your strategy to answer those questions? How did you divide the tasks among your teammates?)
  - [ ] Project results (What did you achieve?)
  - [ ] Impact-outlook (Which value does this project bring? What are the future perspectives? What still needs to be done?)

- **GitHub repo**: Structured & easily readable.
  - [ ] Please comment the code as much as you can. As an example, you may want to have a look at the style guide that we use for Qiskit contributions.
  - [ ] To enforce a consistent code style in the project, we use Pylint and pycodesytle to verify that code contributions conform to and respect the projectâ€™s style guide.
  - [ ] To verify that your changes conform to the style guide, run: `tox -elint`

- **3-minute pre-recorded video presentation**:
  - [ ] Crisp summary of the scientific report
