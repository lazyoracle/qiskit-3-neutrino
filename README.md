## Coding files Negavitation
Our coding files is at folder [notebooks](https://github.com/hanoipho997/Neutrino-oscillations-in-a-3-level-quantum-system/tree/main/notebooks),which include 3 jupyter notebooks, namely NeutrinoOscialltionPython.ipynb, Assess_Higher_new.ipynb, PulseSchedule.ipynb,
The NeutrinoOscialltionPython.ipynb file, which has classical simulations of neutrino oscillation. 
Assess_Higher_new.ipynb file includes spectroscopy and Rabi experiments on ibmq_armonk.
More importantly, the IBM quantum execution of neutrino as a qutrit is in file PulseSchedule.ipynb

### Final Project

**Due Date**: June 4, 2021

The final submission should include:

- **Scientific report** - 2-3 pages in pdf format, including:
  - [ ] Motivation (Which research questions do you want to address with this project?)
  - [ ] Implementation (What was your strategy to answer those questions? How did you divide the tasks among your teammates?)
  - [ ] Project results (What did you achieve?)
  - [ ] Impact-outlook (Which value does this project bring? What are the future perspectives? What still needs to be done?)

- **GitHub repo**: Structured & easily readable.
  - [ ] Please comment the code as much as you can. As an example, you may want to have a look at the style guide that we use for Qiskit contributions.
  - [ ] To enforce a consistent code style in the project, we use Pylint and pycodesytle to verify that code contributions conform to and respect the projectâ€™s style guide.
  - [ ] To verify that your changes conform to the style guide, run: `tox -elint`

- **3-minute pre-recorded video presentation**:
  - [ ] Crisp summary of the scientific report
